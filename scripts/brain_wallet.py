Here's a Python script that generates a Bitcoin brain wallet. Please note that using brain wallets is risky because they depend entirely on the security of the passphrase. If someone else guesses or knows your passphrase, they can access your funds.
This version of the script ensures the private key is generated in the WIF (Wallet Import Format) which is more commonly used:

Important Security Notes:
Do not use this method for storing significant amounts of Bitcoin. Brain wallets are not considered secure for current standards.
Passphrase Strength: The security of your wallet depends entirely on the secrecy and complexity of your passphrase. Use long, unique phrases with numbers, special characters, and mixed case.
Backup: Write down the passphrase securely, since losing it means losing access to your funds.
Security Practices: Never share your passphrase or the generated private key with anyone or store it online where it could be compromised.
This code is for educational purposes to illustrate how such systems work. For actual use, consider safer alternatives like hardware wallets or software wallets with robust security features.

WIF Format: The WIF (Wallet Import Format) is now used for the private key, which includes a checksum for error detection. This format starts with '5' or 'K' or 'L' for uncompressed keys or 'c' or 'C' for compressed keys on Bitcoin mainnet. Here, we use the uncompressed format for simplicity.
Security: As before, remember the security caveats. Brain wallets are not recommended for actual use due to their susceptibility to brute-force attacks, especially with weak passphrases.
Testing: Always test the generated keys in a test environment or with very small amounts before using them in production scenarios.
This script should now provide you with a valid WIF private key along with the Bitcoin address. Remember, for actual use, secure your passphrase meticulously, and consider using established wallet software or hardware for better security.
